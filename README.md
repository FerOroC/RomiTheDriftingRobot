# RomiTheDriftingRobot

Ever wonder what a drag racing toy robot looks like? Well, we did. And we wanted to make it happen. 

This repository relates to the development of a Guidance, Navigation, and Control system for the Romi robot kit which can be found at: https://www.pololu.com/product/4022

A couple more bits and bobs were purchased to fully deck the robot out, including some magnetometer and gyroscope sensors. Please do read the final report which fully explains the scope of the work as well as the results we found.
